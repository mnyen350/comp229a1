        My name is Minh Nguyen, my mission is to break code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quality Assurance is like a game, where the developer is the
        Game Master and the Quality Assurance is the player; I am here to find as many exploits or bugs as possible. 
        The GM should have designed the game in a way no one can break it or clear it in any unexpected ways.
        But as a player, I want the shortest path to clearing as possible and maliciously breaking the design is allowed.
        Of course the goal of Quality Assurance is to create a more perfect, flawless software, but just like learning,
        the only way there is through struggle because nothing is perfect the first time.
